# Bonus Features
# Question 1.
In the LS solution, both the player and dealer totals must be calculated right
before the player's turn (initial outer loop) and recalculated after each
respective hit (within a loop). For the player, this could occur on line 98 and
and before line 110, and for the dealer on line 127 and before line 133.

# Question 2.
The last call to play_again? in the LS solution resets the deck, whereas the
other two calls continue using the remaining available cards. My original
solution used only one call to play_again? because I had assumed that if the
user wanted to play again, the deck would have to be reset to contain all
52 cards. Now my code is written to use the same deck for each round and only
initialize the deck if the current deck is empty or the file is run again from
the start.

# Question 3.
You could create a method called compare_cards that contains the content in
lines 145-148 and call it before display_results and play_again? (e.g., before
line 119, before line 138, and on line 145 replacing lines 145-148).

# Question 4.
Implemented above.

# Question 5.
Implemented above.
