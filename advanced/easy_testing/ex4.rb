# Small Problems Easy Testing - Problem 4: Empty Object Assertions
# Fri. 01/08/2021

=begin
Write a minitest assertion that will fail if the Array list is not empty.

assert_empty(list)


# Further Exploration
=begin
- could also use assert_equal(true, list.empty?)
- assert_empty issues a better failure message
=end
